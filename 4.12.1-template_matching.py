# Template Matching is a method for searching and finding the location of a template image in a larger image. OpenCV comes with a function cv2.matchTemplate() for this purpose. It simply slides the template image over the input image (as in 2D convolution) and compares the template and patch of input image under the template image. Several comparison methods are implemented in OpenCV. (You can check docs for more details). It returns a grayscale image, where each pixel denotes how much does the neighbourhood of that pixel match with template.

# If input image is of size (WxH) and template image is of size (wxh), output image will have a size of (W-w+1, H-h+1). Once you got the result, you can use cv2.minMaxLoc() function to find where is the maximum/minimum value. Take it as the top-left corner of rectangle and take (w,h) as width and height of the rectangle. That rectangle is your region of template.

# If you are using cv2.TM_SQDIFF as comparison method, minimum value gives the best match.

# Here, as an example, we will search for Messiâ€™s face in his photo.

img = cv2.imread(r'pictures\messi5.jpg', 0)
img2 = img.copy()
template = cv2.imread(r'pictures\messi_face.jpg', 0)
w, h = template.shape[::-1]

# All the 6 methods for comparison in a list
methods = ['cv2.TM_CCOEFF', 'cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED', 'cv2.TM_CCORR', 'cv2.TM_CCORR_NORMED', 'cv2.TM_SQDIFF', 'cv2.TM_SQDIFF_NORMED']

for meth in methods:
    img = img2.copy()
    method = eval(meth)

    # Apply template Matching
    res = cv2.matchTemplate(img, template, method)
    min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(res)

    # If the method is TM_SQDIFF or TM_SQDIFF_NORMED, take minimum
    if method in [cv2.TM_SQDIFF, cv2.TM_SQDIFF_NORMED]:
        top_left = min_loc
    else:
        top_left = max_loc
    bottom_right = (top_left[0] + w, top_left[1] + h)

    cv2.rectangle(img, top_left, bottom_right, 255, 2)

    plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(res, cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Matching Result'), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
    plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Detected Point', ), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
    plt.suptitle(meth)

    plt.show()

# You can see that the result using cv2.TM_CCORR is not good as we expected.
